# ASP.net-core-6-Crud-razorpage-modal-template

This project contains a initial template file for create crud modal operation with Asp.net core 6 razor pages

There are several examples about creting CRUD modal operation with Asp.Net core in all flavors, but i need a template like that come by default with VS, when you create entities and dbcontext and you Scaffold this entities to create CRUD operations, the default template create 5 diferent pages (index, create, detail, edit, delete) that works fine but in razor pages you can do it all in just 1 page using modals.
